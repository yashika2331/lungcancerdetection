# lungcancerdetection
**Overview**
This project aims to develop a lung cancer detection system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system is designed to analyze medical images, typically X-ray or CT scans, to assist in the early detection of lung cancer.
**Features**
Detect and classify lung cancer from medical images.
Utilizes deep learning models for image analysis.
Implements data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
Provides the ability to handle real-time or stored images for analysis.
**Prerequisites**
Python (version X.X)
Libraries: OpenCV, Pillow, scikit-learn, imageio
Deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet50)
Knowledge of machine learning concepts
